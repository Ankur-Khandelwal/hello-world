# hello-world
This is the first repository that I am creating. My first step into GitHub.

This is Ankur! I am a first year student in International Institute of Information Technology, Bhubaneswar.
I am pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. My interest in GitHub came from a Hacktoberfest Event in my college.
